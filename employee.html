              Lisa is looking for a new lease on life. She realizes that
              she never really does what she wants to do. She wanted to be
              in theater, but her parents wanted her to go to college and get
              a "real job". She has a never give up personality and you can
              expect her to help you if you need it.

                Lisa thinks the company itself has it perks, but she's
                seen what it's really like on the inside. She expects
                the service to be top notch, after she handles all
                the politics involved with going into outer space.
                Lisa has seen how happy and how people have changed
                after their trip into space and she wants that to
                happen to her.

                    Lisa paid for a trip to the Bahamas through an startup
                    called WeShipIt. They promised all sorts of things in the
                    pre-packaged service. She carefully read over all the documents
                    she signed before leaving for her trip. After she got back,
                    she sued them into bankruptcy because they didn't deliver one of
                    the services in the package.

                    Lisa only takes in information from reliable and trusted sources, like
                    certain newspapers and websites.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If a service that is being promised is too good to be true, Lisa
                    won't even try it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If all the services add up to her reasonable ball park range, she will try it.
