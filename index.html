    <h2>Short Pitch</h2>
    <p>Space Pixie's goal is for everyday people to be able to go to moon (and if they miss they are among the stars).</p>
    <h2>Long Pitch</h2>
    <p>
    Our goal is the same today as it is everyday, "Get people to the moon". Whether it is helping people to
    gain the funds to travel, the training required, or tests that need to be done we are there to help. We help
    people with creating budgets and savings plan so that a person can afford it. We help you find the training
    you need to be able to go on an adventure of a lifetime. We love to nurture that passion that people had when
    they were kids. The dreams of being an astronaut, we seek to make that dream a reality. All we do, is give these
    dreamers a little bit of help. We are to be guides the lead people out of this world.
