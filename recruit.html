                Kyle loves the idea of helping others achieve their dreams. He wants to
                be able to help people do something that one day he'll do himself, so he
                knows what to expect. He was looking up Wikipedia articles when he ended
                up on the company's Wikipedia page. One thing led to another and now he
                wants to work for Space Pixie.

                    Kyle's friend lost her you puppy and was looking for him. After a day,
                    no one was able to find the puppy. Kyle posted a missing poster and paid $30
                    for a one time posting HaveYouSeenMe and got a hit matching the description
                    in an hour. Kyle ran out in the pouring rain to look for the puppy and didn't
                    find it until two hours later. After he delivered the puppy back to his friend,
                    he came home with the biggest smile on his face. He talks about HaveYouSeen
                    me for a year straight after that.
